Ugh, man that was packed well, is there nothing they can't damage!

It's fully insured, simply file a damage claim with USPS. You have everything you need: tracking number, proof of damage (pictures), proof of value (PayPal or eBay receipt). Damage claim can be filed online easily at: https://www.usps.com/help/claims.htm

This is why I insure everything, to protect your investment. Let me know if have any questions.

Good evening;

RE: your current bid on my item "Trader Sams Mahaloween Shrunken Skull." I see you have no feedback, unfortunately I have had numerous low/no feedback users not pay for items they won. I need to verify that you are serious, and have an active PayPal account to pay for this should you ultimately be the high bidder.

Please respond as soon as possible so I can feel comfortable with your commitment.

Thank you!
Jeffrey
